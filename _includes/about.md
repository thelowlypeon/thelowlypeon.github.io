I’m a <del>mid</del> <del>late-twenties</del> early-thirties tech guy. Been the latter for as long as I can remember (and the former not quite as long).

I’m proud to call myself a Chicagoan, born and raised, though I’ve spent only a small part of the last decade here. I’ve been doing a bit of globe-trotting for the last few years, though, spending time in Colorado, California, and southeast Asia. After my first visit to China in 2005, I declared I’d return by the end of 2007. I did, and stayed there for nearly five years, working for an international manufacturing company in Hangzhou, China. After a short stint in Houston, I’m now back in sweet home, Chicago.

Much of my life in the last few years has been influenced by my pseudo-degree in startup life. The company I co-founded died after about a year, but <a href="http://outofsomething.com">Out of Something</a>, my pseudo-thesis, is still going strong, in oft-changing form.

I now bike every day to work at <a href="https://onedesigncompany.com/about">One Design Company</a> as a sr software engineer, where I was welcomed as family and learn new stuff every day.

I believe in logic above all else.
