I'm just another mid-thirties software engineer. But how I got here is what makes me, well, me.

I've always liked math.
But I spent my life in high school playing music and making hot glass art.
I went to college to be a [film major](/projects/film),
then decided I'd rather _watch_ films than make them,
so I decided to study astro-physics,
before I realized you could learn all the interesting stuff by watching the Discover Science channel and the rest was physics.
After taking some physics classes,
I realized physics is all calculus.
So I returned to studying math.
Then I discovered you could do really cool math stuff by writing some code.
So I wrote code.

Meanwhile, I got into a [Japanese poet](http://amzn.to/2df3cHp),
and discovered most of his work was originally written in Chinese.
Outraged by a terrible translation of a beautiful poem, I decided to study Chinese
so I could understand the original.
And then I realized that the Chinese I was studying was about eight centuries different.
But I enjoyed it, so I studied and played Chinese Chess for a semester in Kunming.
I loved being there so much I declared that by the end of the following year,
I'd live there, doing whatever it took to do so.

And then opportunity fell on my lap: a friend put me in touch with someone looking for an American who could speak some Chinese and understood computers.
So, with a handshake, I committed to six months in Hangzhou, China, where I wrote custom ERP software, wrote a lot of SQL, managed the IT of a dozen or so offices, and ate lots of 蛋饼.
Once Hangzhou installed [bikeshare](/films/commute), six months turned into four years.

Since then,
I returned to the states to start a company that failed,
built a website that sold subscriptions to notebooks
(and subsequently built our [competitor's website](http://fieldnotesbrand.com)),
have led a few teams of excellent engineers,
wrote [a couple](http://eastmanegg.com/app) [of iOS](https://stationtostationapp.com) [apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/no-js/id1062685513?mt=8),
and met countless wonderful people.

And now, I live in Chicago with my wife (and, soon, our daughter!),
I bike everywhere,
run a few times a week,
and travel back to China as often as I can.
