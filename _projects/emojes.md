In about three hours, while my daughter wouldn't fall asleep, I built a stupid site with one purpose: embiggen your emoji.

Remember at WWDC 2016, when Apple announced that sending three or fewer emoji in iMessage would make them larger? Well, emoj.es is even better.

Send a link to emoj.es in iMessage, and it'll automatically fetch a preview of the page, and the image meta tag will point to a huge image of your emoji.

It's simple: just type `emoj.es/` and enter your emoji. Add another slash and some url-encoded text to see it as the title.

For example:

```
http://emoj.es/ðŸ˜Ž/oh%20yeah
```

will result in a huge sunglasses emoji with "oh yeah" in the text.

Try it!
