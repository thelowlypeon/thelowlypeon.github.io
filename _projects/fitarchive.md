### Your source of truth for activity data.

Online services come and go. They change formats, strip fields, or lose your history altogether. FIT Archive gives you control by storing your **original FIT files**—the complete, untampered record of your cycling, running, and other activities.

With FIT Archive you get:

* **Permanent storage of originals**
  Your data stays intact, regardless of which platforms rise or fall in the future.

* **Every field, always visible**
  Thanks to [PureFIT](http://github.com/thelowlypeon/purefit)—a custom parser built from the ground up—you can see every field in your FIT files, even those unrecognized by the official profile. No data is lost, skipped, or hidden.

* **Confidence in the details**
  Compare exported files from different services to your originals. Spot what’s missing. Know what’s been altered. Trust the source.

FIT Archive is built for people who care about the long game—athletes whose lives revolve around consistent activity, and who want their training history to last as long as they do. Whether you’re planning for future insights or simply protecting your past, FIT Archive keeps your data safe, complete, and under your control.
