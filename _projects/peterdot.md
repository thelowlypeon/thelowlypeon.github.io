In the last couple of weeks, three people independently asked me for advice on how to learn to program, specifically for the web.

It's always been hard for me to make recommendations like that, both because everyone learns differently and because my understanding of the value of knowing how to program has changed so much over there years.

I learned how to build websites by building websites. With a lot of help from [a good friend](http://bentomas.com), I started with an insanely simple static site on a subdomain he setup for me: *peter.thescruffypirate.org*. I learned some HTML and CSS, and the basics of how Apache works.

I quickly got bored with my static site, so I made it into a blog, with posts stored in a database. From that, I learned how to connect to a MySQL database, some basic relational database concepts, and scratched the surface of protecting against SQL injection.

And it continued that way for a few years: when I wanted to learn something new, or had an idea for a new feature, I'd figure out how to do it, and do it.

Eventually, the site turned into a small social network (before social networks were all the rage). I left my comfortable subdomain, peter.thescruffypirate.org, and registered my first ever domain: [peterdot.com](http://peterdot.com).

Having been built up over the years by a guy who knew nothing about what he was doing, the code grew pretty gross pretty quickly. So after a while, I did a complete rebuild, and threw up a redirect on peterdot.

It wasn't until these friends asked me how to learn to code that I decided to dig up peterdot and see how much I've changed. And boy, have I come a long way.

The site was _completely_ vulnerable to SQL-injection, among other things. So I converted it into a static site until I could invest more time into making it a bit less vulnerable. But in the meantime, it's been a ton of fun reading through the old content and remembering how much time we spent on that site.
