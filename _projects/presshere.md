## Press Here!

* Super satisfying touch!
* Pick your favorite color!
* Try them big! Or try them small!
* Reset automatically, manually, or test your luck with randomized reset!
* Keep track of how many times you've popped!
* Press Here! with your friends or siblings at the same time!

Press Here! works on iPad and iPhone (iOS 17+), as well as watchOS, and is available in English and Chinese (simplified).

#### Privacy

Press Here!, like all the apps I write, doesn't collect, store, or share any of your data.
There is a fun counter to see how many popits you've popped, and how many times you've reset the grid,
but that is for your enjoyment only and never leaves your device.
