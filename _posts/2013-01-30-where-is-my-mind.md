The following are all true statements:

1. I’ve forgotten my keys four times in my whole life. 

2. I’ve forgotten my keys four times in the last two weeks. 

3. I’ve forgotten my laundry card on the way to the laundry room once in my life. 

4. I’ve forgotten my laundry card on the way to the laundry room today. 

Need to work less.
