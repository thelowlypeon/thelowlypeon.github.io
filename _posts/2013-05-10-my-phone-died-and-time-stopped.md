Last night, while on a drunk with my new friends and colleagues, my phone's battery died around 9:45. The evening didn't stop then, but time did:

So I'm told, for over an hour, each time we came across to a bar that had closed, I shouted my confusion and anger by saying "what the fuck, it's only 9:45!" The bars closed at 12 or 1.
