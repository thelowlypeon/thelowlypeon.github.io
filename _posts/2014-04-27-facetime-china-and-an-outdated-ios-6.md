My wife and I have a lot of ties in China, and as such, spend a good amount of time on FaceTime with one end in the states and one end in China. For the last two weeks, making a FaceTime call would show the status "connecting" for an instant and then fail. 

I did a bunch of research, trying to make this work, contacted carious friends in China, and tried a few things. (We were a bit paralyzed on one end because my parents in-law aren't too tech savvy, and it's harder to explain things to then when we can't, well, FaceTime.)

Research showed that devices purchased since mid 2013 _in China_ had certain limitations because of a Chinese patent for a similar technology. But each of the devices we were trying had been purchased in the US (and unlocked if applicable).

Turns out the solution was simple: they were running an older version of iOS 6. **Stepping them through an upgrade to iOS 7 was reasonably easy over the phone/iMessage, and once the upgrade was complete (and they remembered their passwords), we were golden**. 

For anyone with similar issues, this was problematic for us only in mid April, 2014.
