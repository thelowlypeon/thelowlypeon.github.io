I love where I work. I work out of the [best coworking space in Chicago](http://coworkchicago.com/) (the best city on Earth — does this mean, by commutative property, that I work at the best coworking space on Earth? Maybe.)

There I have a great setup: an Apple Cinema Display, a Das Keyboard, a little thingy to prop my laptop up so the screen is level with my display, and a cute little bamboo thing that someone put on my desk a while ago and has stayed there.

Over the last ten or so months since I started working there, from what I've gathered, I've grown a reputation for two things:

1.  **My keyboard is loud as hell**. Some people hate this but a surprising number of people appreciate it because it adds white noise so they can have more private conversations.
2.  **My display is precious to me**. So don't fuck with it.

The former is apparent to anyone who walks within a one mile radius of the office, and the latter is because any time there's some kind of event and we need to move our stuff around, I make an unreasonably big deal about what to do about my display so no one fucks with it.

* * *

Two weeks ago, I left the office for the last time before a two week trip to China. I cleaned up my desk so someone else could use it (it is, after all, a coworking space). I moved my display into the corner, turned it facing away from the desk (but still protected from the sun), unplugged it, and wrapped up the cables. I moved the rest of my stuff into neat piles nearby. I figured this, along with my reputation, would leave my display safe. To be sure, I asked a few people to watch it. (Or at least I thought I did.)

* * *

This this morning, my first day back in the office, I came to the office to find all my stuff curiously set up, and my display -- gasp! -- covered in fingerprints. The instant I saw it I shouted "**someone finger-raped my display!**"

(Let me be clear: there is absolutley&nbsp;_no_ way the fingerprints were mine. Maybe a spot or two from eating at my desk, but&nbsp;_absolutely no fingerprints on my display_. If I ever touch it by mistake, I clean it immediately after.)

* * *

That got me to thinking:

Maybe I'm too possessive about my stuff. Maybe I value physical objects too much. Maybe I'm too attached to my things. Maybe I should be a better hippy and let other people use my stuff when I'm not. Maybe I should be more sharing. Maybe I shouldn't get so upset — I mean, after all, it only took my twenty minutes and some magic cleaning stuff to wipe all the smudges off. Right?

Wait, on second thought,&nbsp;_fuck that_._

**Don't touch my stuff**.
