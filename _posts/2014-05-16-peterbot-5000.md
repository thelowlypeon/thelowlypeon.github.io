If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I'm not sure what to think about someone writing a robot that tweets random things in a language similar to mine. Artificial _super intelligence_?

[@vxhex](http://twitter.com/vxhex) recently took it upon himself to write a script that scrapes this blog, throws the content into a natural language engine, and automatically tweets the results.

What this robot says is amazing. Here are some choice examples:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Rather than using words, consider using Skype to call my mom.</p>— PeterBot5000 (@oothepeter) <a href="https://twitter.com/oothepeter/statuses/467289984035475456">May 16, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I take extremely good care of my Apache installation that plagued me for three solid days.</p>— PeterBot5000 (@oothepeter) <a href="https://twitter.com/oothepeter/statuses/466226454116589569">May 13, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>This strategy had two enormous problems: this also means that if the Chinese government blocks or tampers with Skype, I am hard.</p>— PeterBot5000 (@oothepeter) <a href="https://twitter.com/oothepeter/statuses/465869173164216321">May 12, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>In effort to not disturb the times, I have lots of cheap wine, and do not need a unified inbox</p>— PeterBot5000 (@oothepeter) <a href="https://twitter.com/oothepeter/statuses/465607244860510209">May 11, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The sequence is insanely simple : start with 0 and 1 : Broken Social Scene, Joni Mitchell, Arcade Fire, all the time.</p>— PeterBot5000 (@oothepeter) <a href="https://twitter.com/oothepeter/statuses/464190675391483905">May 7, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>After being at this number, how can any other company use this information as proof that I don't care?</p>— PeterBot5000 (@oothepeter) <a href="https://twitter.com/oothepeter/statuses/464067804224692225">May 7, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The attack is theorized to have calls come into my mobile, and it drives me nuts doing that.</p>— PeterBot5000 (@oothepeter) <a href="https://twitter.com/oothepeter/statuses/465150121672331264">May 10, 2014</a></blockquote>

I should note that I had nothing to do with this, but think it's hilarious. And I strongly suggest you all follow [@oothepeter](http://twitter.com/oothepeter).
