A few weeks ago I was invited to speak with Noah Bernson on [CTRL+CLICK CAST](http://ctrlclickcast.com/episodes/ecommerce-shipping-fulfillment)
about ecommerce and order fulfillment.

For those of you who don't want to listen to me talk for an hour (which should be
all of you), because they're fantastic, the good people at CTRL+CLICK have
[transcribed the entire podcast](http://cdn.ctrlclickcast.com/transcripts/2016/ctrlclickcast-081.pdf "I love the fact that they did this and wish all podcast people would.").

It was a first for me, being on a podcast, and now I join the ranks of tech people who clutter
their RSS feeds with self promotional podcast advertisements! Huzzah!

It was a lot of fun chatting with Lea & Emily (and Noah, of course). It was a bit
hectic chatting with the Cubs parade going on outside
(aka [the 7th largest gathering in human history](http://www.fox32chicago.com/news/local/215601786-story))
and the footsteps on the creaky floor above us, but I think it turned out well.

Hope you enjoy it, and thanks for the invite, CTRL+CLICK CAST!
