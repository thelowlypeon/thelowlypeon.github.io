Why? Because you can save 10% on almost everything.

[Discover Card](http://bit.ly/1MSwzdU) recently rolled out support for Apple Pay, Apple's new secure payment method. To promote it, they're offering an _additional_ 10% cashback on all store purchases (excluding gift cards ([maybe?](http://www.doctorofcredit.com/discover-10-bonus-with-apple-pay-2000-profit-per-discover-card/))) for up to $10,000 in purchases in 2015. 

## Shifting your habits

$10,000 seems like a lot of money to spend, especially in just over three months. But you know what? So is the $1,100 you'll get back if you do things right. You may not spend all $10,000, but it's probably easy to get close.*

* For example, I preordered an **iPhone 6S** before finding out about the deal. So I went to the Apple Store once I received it, returned it, and bought it back using Apple Pay in the store. That's $80 cashback right off the bat.**
* I use T-Mobile for my **cell phone service**, and they accept Apple Pay (at some stores), so I can pay my bills for the next three months.
* All of the **grocery stores** we frequent accept Apple Pay -- Jewel, Whole Foods, Trader Joes -- and we spend about $500/mo on groceries, and a few hundred on **booze** at said grocery stores. (The [booze](http://boxwino.com) usually ends up being cheaper at grocery stores anyway.)
* Ventra, the payment processor for CTA (**public transit** here in Chicago) fares, accepts Apple Pay at train stations. Good bye, automatic deduction; hello monthly stops at the nearest station to load up my card!
* We don't go to **Starbucks** often, but I'll be sure to load up our account before the year is up. It'll last us a year, feel like free coffee, and it'll give us a good 10% off everything.
* A [whole bunch of other merchants](http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/where-to-use-apple-pay/) accept Apple Pay, and therefore accept Discover+Apple Pay. Like Coca-Cola vending machines or Nike.
* (Some somewhat fishy people on the interwebs have suggested going to **Walgreens** and buying gift cards, which apparently works but isn't supposed to.)


## Don't have a Discover Card?

Then you should! 

* There's no annual fee, so it doesn't hurt. 
* They give you your credit score for free. 
* They give you 1% cashback on all purchases (which isn't special nowadays), and 5% cashback on bonus categories. So even if you _only_ use it for bonus categories, it's worth it. 
* Right now the bonus category is Amazon, for example. Amazon! Why _not_ save 5% on all Amazon purchases?
* Their customer service is _excellent_. They have a two-ring policy! And they follow it! I love these guys.

If you get a new card, you could even get 22% cashback, because of a Discover [promo to get double cashback through the end of the year](http://www.doctorofcredit.com/discover-extends-double-cashback-offer-for-new-cardmembers-should-we-bite/)!

\* Discover already gives 1% cashback on all non-bonus categories. The bonus categories through December are Amazon (not in-store), and department stores. Which means for department stores, you're getting 15% cashback. Crazy!

\*\* I pay cash for my iPhones to avoid ridiculously priced service plans. And Cook County has ridiculously high sales taxes and TIFs.

\*\*\* So will I!
