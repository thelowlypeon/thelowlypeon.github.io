A little over a year ago, my sister Nell had an idea for an app and set out to build it.

The idea is simple: there are a lot of people in our lives that mean a lot to us,
but too often, if there's not a specific reason to reach out, our relationships get put on the backburner
and the barrier to bring them closer gets higher and higher.
So what if we had a way to just give us a little nudge to... break the ice?

I was an early technical advisor, helping with some of the early and foundational decisions, and, ultimately,
helping to find a technical partner to work with long term.
Despite the shakey start, I am _so happy_ about how it turned out, and super proud of Nell and her team for what they've accomplished.

_Kythe is about fostering a deep sense of real, human connection with those you love._

You and your loved ones create a circle, and every few days, GPT asks a question based on your common interests.
For example, I love chatting with my inlaws, but our lives are so different
there often isn't anything to talk about, so we end up going months without chatting.
I've been using it for a few months now and _love it_. And the iconography is delightful.

I highly recommend [checking it out](https://kytheapp.com)!
