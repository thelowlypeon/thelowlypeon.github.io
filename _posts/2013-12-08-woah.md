I just realized that "[It Hurts Me Too](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Hurts_Me_Too)," the old standard first recorded in 1940 by Tampa Red, and made famous by the Grateful Dead much later in the late 60s / early 70s, and "[Pledging My Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledging_My_Time)," the Bob Dylan not-so-original off of Blonde on Blonde, are pretty much the same song.
