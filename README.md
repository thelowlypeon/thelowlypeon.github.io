# Peter Compernolle

This is my site! Welcome.

Originally I had this thing built in a rather bloated Rails application,
using a gem I wrote called [mumblr](https://github.com/thelowlypeon/mumblr)
to update the content via Tumblr. Now it's a super simple Jekyll-generated static site.

## Installation

I have no idea why you'd want to install or run this yourself, but if you do,
(or, more likely, if _I_ do), clone the project, run bundle install, then serve:

```
$ git clone ...
$ bundle install
$ jekyll serve
```

Then go to [127.0.0.1:4000](https://127.0.0.1:4000) in a browser.
